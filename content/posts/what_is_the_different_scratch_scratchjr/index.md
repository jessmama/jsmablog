### scratch與scratchJr的相同點
* 皆為提供給兒童設計程式所使用的免費軟體
* 皆為積木程式，使用點擊及拖拉(click and drag)方式撰寫程式

###  scratch與scratchJr的差異比較
| 差異 | ScratchJr |Scratch|
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| 適合學習年齡  | 5 ~ 7歲 | 8 ~ 15歲 |
| 所使用的裝置 | 平板 | 電腦 |
| 使用方式 | 下載即可使用| 在網站上註冊後即可使用 |


### 有差異的積木功能

#### 音效 (Sound effects)

Only one “pop” sound is available to use in ScratchJr. 
However kids can record any sounds they want. 
Though the recording time is limited to a minute.

#### 角色之間傳送訊息 (Broadcasts)

ScratchJr has a limited number of broadcast blocks: up to six on each page. 
Instead of passing a message in the form of text, each broadcast block contains a letter indicating a color associated with its specific message.

#### 對手機畫面的適應度 (Optimized for mobile)

ScratchJr is optimized for mobile and tablet devices, as opposed to Scratch which is built for computers.
 The ability to touch the screen of an iPad or an Android tablet helps make ScratchJr more accessible, too.

#### 畫面上的大小 (Grid system)

ScratchJr's stage is divided into a grid that is 20 x 15 squares in size. 
Unlike Scratch's stage, which uses regular pixels that are not broken into a grid.

#### 小畫家功能/自己繪製圖案 (Paint editor)

In ScratchJr, there's a paint editor where kids can alter pre-existing sprite/backgrounds or draw something of their choice. 
This feature helps kids learn how to create and express themselves.

#### 背景功能 (Pages/stage)

In ScratchJr, pages are "scenes" that hold their own sprites, background, and broadcasts. 
And you can only have up to 4 pages per project. 
Whereas in Scratch, students can make many more backdrops.
