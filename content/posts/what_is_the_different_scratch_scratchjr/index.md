### 有差異的積木功能

#### Sound effects

Only one “pop” sound is available to use in ScratchJr. However kids can record any sounds they want. Though the recording time is limited to a minute.

#### Broadcasts

ScratchJr has a limited number of broadcast blocks: up to six on each page. Instead of passing a message in the form of text, each broadcast block contains a letter indicating a color associated with its specific message.

#### Optimized for mobile

ScratchJr is optimized for mobile and tablet devices, as opposed to Scratch which is built for computers. The ability to touch the screen of an iPad or an Android tablet helps make ScratchJr more accessible, too.

#### Grid system

ScratchJr's stage is divided into a grid that is 20 x 15 squares in size. Unlike Scratch's stage, which uses regular pixels that are not broken into a grid.

#### Paint editor

In ScratchJr, there's a paint editor where kids can alter pre-existing sprite/backgrounds or draw something of their choice. This feature helps kids learn how to create and express themselves.

#### Pages/stage

In ScratchJr, pages are "scenes" that hold their own sprites, background, and broadcasts. And you can only have up to 4 pages per project. Whereas in Scratch, students can make many more backdrops.
